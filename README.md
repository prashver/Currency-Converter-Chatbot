# Currency-Converter-Chatbot

I have created a conversational chatbot whose main task is to do a currency conversion. Apart from doing the currency conversion it can also handle small tasks to provide a user friendly environment. The main pre-requisites which are used here are flask, python and Dialogflow (which is a humanâ€“computer interaction technology based on natural language owned by Google developers. The company is best for creating the Assistant, a virtual buddy for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone smartphones.)

For the chatbot to perform the currency conversion task, it uses [API](https://www.currencyconverterapi.com/) to give the desired output, which the user is particularly seeking for. 

Flow wise, it takes two values from user; first the currency with the value which is to be converted and the other to which currency it should convert to.
